# TODO

* write this README.md
* implement more robustness to handle inappropriate project structures 
  * if no src file, fix imports in students .java files when moving them into newly built src file 
* implement feature to go ahead and add the TA teams test suite to the projects
* could potentially make more modular, i.e., create functions. Don't think requires multiple files...yet
