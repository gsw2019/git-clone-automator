## TODO

* write this README.md
* implement more robustness to handle inappropriate project structures 
  * if no src file, look at imports in each .java file and build the packages in addition to src file
  * ensure .classpath file has minimal requirements
    * incorrect name of user library
* implement feature to go ahead and add the TA teams test suite to the projects
* **make order of arguments not strict**
* could potentially make more modular, i.e., create functions. Don't think requires multiple files...yet
